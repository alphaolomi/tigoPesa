# API Specification 

## Introduction

This section covers the API specifications. Each service is divided in a Request and Response section containing the overview of the parameters and example requests and responses. The list of error codes is included in Annex A.6.4.

The following third-level domains are available for the Tigo Secure services:

`https://securesandbox.tigo.com/test` environment

`https://secure.tigo.com/production` environment

In the sections below the service URLs are relative to these two Tigo Secure domains. For example for a service called 'service1' the following URL is specified in the API specification:

<_domain>/v1/service1_

To use service1 on the test environment use the URL: `https://securesandbox.tigo.com/v1/service1`

and on the production environment: `https://secure.tigo.com/v1/service1`

1. **Generate Access Token Service**

The Generate Access Token service is used to get a valid access token. The Millicom partner can only use the assigned API services via this access token. The access token has to be specified in each request header as described in the sub paragraphs below.

The validity of the access token is time limited and after each session the token is invalidated irrespective whether the service call resulted in a positive result or a failure. The expiry time is specified in the response.

**4.3.1. Request**

    "account":"255321321321",
    "pin":"1234",
    "id":"CompanyName"
  },
  "Merchant":{
    "reference":"Amazon",
    "fee":"23.45",
    "currencyCode":"EUR"
  },
  "Subscriber":{
    "account":"255111111111", 
    "countryCode": "255",
    "country":"tza",
    "firstName":"John",
    "lastName":"Doe",

    "amount":"218223.00",
    "currencyCode":"TZS"
    },
  "transactionRefId":"0a1e39ab"
}
``` 
Make sure to **use the Access Token only**** once **to initiate a Payment**
**Authorization**. For each Payment Authorization request a new accesstoken has to be generated. This is because the access token is invalidated after the transaction completed. Any other additional transaction initiated with the same access token will therefore fail.

Per Payment Authorization make sure to **use a unique transaction**** reference identifier** (transactionRefId) to identify the transaction. This will guarantee that the transaction is logged and traced correctly.

## Response 

Average response time:< 1 second
Maximum response time: 5 seconds
HTTP response code: 200 OK

| **Parameter** | **#** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| transactionRefId | 1 | String | Unique reference Identifier of the transaction |
| redirectUrl | 1 | String | Tigo Secure redirect URL which has to be used to <br>redirect the Customer to the correct Tigo Secure Payment Authorization webpage |
| authCode | 1 | String | Unique code to authenticate the transaction for the customer when redirecting |
| creationDateTime | 1 | String | Transaction Creation Date and Time |

## Payment Authorization Response parameters

"transactionRefId":"0a1e39ab",
"redirectUrl":" https://securesandbox.tigo.com/v1/payment\_auth/transactions?â€¦ auth\_code=123123123&transaction\_ref\_id=0a1e39ab&lang=eng",
"authCode" : "123123123",
"creationDateTime":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 13:58:25 UTC"
}
``` 

## Payment status callback 
After the customer completes the payment via Tigo Secure the status is reported back. This is done via the optional callback URI or â€“ in case this callback URI has not been specified â€“ in the redirect URI as specified in the Payment Authorization Request. The optional callback URI will be called reporting back the transaction status with the following parameters:

| **Method** | POST |
| --- | --- | 
| **Headers** | `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` |
| **Body** | trans\_status=`<transaction status success/fail>`&transaction\_ref\_Id=`<transaction_refID>`&<br>external\_ref\_id=`<external\_ref\_id>`&<br>mfs\_id=`<mfs\_id>`& <br>verification\_code=`<Access Token>`&<br>error\_code=`<error\_code>` |

 | **Parameter** | **Description** |
|-----------------|----------------|
 | **trans\_status** | Transaction status: success for a successful transaction <br>fail in case of a failed transaction |
 | **transaction\_ref\_id** | Transaction Reference Identifier as specified in the request |
 | **external\_ref\_id** | _[optional]_| Tigo transaction Id of the request and <br>responses between the internal servers <br>This will only be sent back in case of a successful payment |
| **mfs\_id** | _[optional]_ MFS Platform transaction id of the payment. This will only be sent back in case of a successful payment |
| **verification\_code** | _[optional]_ The verification code is the invalidated <br>Access Token as generated at the start of the payment <br>authorization flow. This code has to be used to <br>uniquely identify that payment status is reported back by Tigo Secure. <br>Note that this access token is invalided after the <br>transaction failed/succeeded/expired so it can't be reused. <br>The verification code (Access Token) will be omitted <br>in case the transaction failed. This is to prevent that a malicious callback can be done with a modified <br>transaction status. |
| **error\_code** | _[optional]_ The error code in case the transaction <br>failed. The error codes are defined in Annex A.6.4.1.


## Payment status callback parameters 

**Successful payment callback example:**
```html
POST HTTP/1.1

Host: <callback URI>

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Cache-Control: no-cache

trans\_status= **success** &transaction\_ref\_id=0a1e39ab &external\_ref\_id=38c1069f-2497-4f9c-9&mfs\_id=CO140924.1414.A00113& **verification\_code** =pfCIHgyWWg6qsUIOVFS u2HR3F4jy&lang=eng
``` 

The verification code in the status callback is the invalidated

Access Token as generated at the start of the payment transaction.

**In order to confirm that successful payment status has been reported back by Tigo Secure the following steps have to be performed:**

1. Lookup the payment transaction using the transaction\_ref\_id

1. Compare the verification\_code against the original access token as used during the transaction

1. Only when the verification\_code is equal to the original access token can the payment be treated as successful.

In case of a **mismatch** between the verification code and the access token the transaction should be **treated as failed** and

reported back to Millicom. The external\_ref\_id and transaction\_id can be used for traceability of the transaction within the Millicom Tigo Operation.

**Failed payment example:**

```html
POST HTTP/1.1

Host: <callback URI>

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Cache-Control: no-cache

trans\_status= **fail** &transaction\_ref\_id=0a1e39ab-d0ec -4f8b-9746-b2c4122220b2123&error\_code= purchase-3008-30434-E>
``` 

For a failed transaction the verification code (access token) is not reported back. This is to prevent a malicious callback with a modified transaction status.

After the payment status callback a HTTP redirect will be done to the URI as specified in the redirectUri parameter in the Payment Authorization Request without any extra parameters.

Note that in case no callbackUri was specified in the original request the payment status is reported back in the redirectUri in the manner as for the callback URI explained above.
