# Introduction

This is an attempt to re-write the official tigoPesa's API in a developer friendly way.
the current documentantion is written in pdf which makes it difficult to work on and hard to
browse through the documentation. This is an attampt to make it easier for developers to work on this new & exciting
API. [Read More About the tigoPesa API here](https://www.tigo.co.tz/tigo-pesa-for-developers)

## Getting Started

This documentation is created using mkdocs so to run it locally you need to have python, pip and ofcourse mkdocs installed

### To install `mkdocs` just run the following command

`pip install mkdocs`

Start the live-reloading docs server.

`mkdocs serve`

Now you can view the documentation by just going to

`http://localhost:8000`
