# TigoPesa API Documentation


This is an attempt to re-write the official Tigopesa docs in a developer friendly way. A lot of effort was spent to make this as accurate as possible, However, If there is any error/confusion please refer to the original documents.

## Contributions

This documentation is created using `mkdocs` therefore in order run it locally you need to have python, [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and ofcourse [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) installed

Using venv

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the live-reloading docs server.

```sh
mkdocs serve
```

Now you can view the documentation by just going to `http://localhost:8000`
